## 🏗️ Technical Debt Description
**What technical debt needs to be addressed?**

A clear description of the technical debt, including:
- What code/architecture is problematic
- Why it's considered technical debt
- What impact it's having on the project

## 🔍 Root Cause
**What led to this technical debt?**

- [ ] **Legacy code** (old patterns, outdated libraries)
- [ ] **Quick fixes** (temporary solutions that became permanent)
- [ ] **Missing abstractions** (repeated code, no shared components)
- [ ] **Performance issues** (slow algorithms, inefficient queries)
- [ ] **Security concerns** (vulnerabilities, outdated dependencies)
- [ ] **Testing gaps** (missing tests, poor coverage)
- [ ] **Documentation debt** (outdated docs, missing examples)

## 📊 Impact Assessment
**What is the impact of this technical debt?**

- **Performance impact**: How does it affect speed/resource usage?
- **Maintenance impact**: How hard is it to maintain/modify?
- **Development impact**: How does it slow down development?
- **User impact**: How does it affect user experience?

## 💡 Proposed Solution
**How should this technical debt be addressed?**

- [ ] **Refactor existing code** (restructure without changing behavior)
- [ ] **Replace with better solution** (new implementation)
- [ ] **Add missing tests** (improve test coverage)
- [ ] **Update dependencies** (upgrade libraries, frameworks)
- [ ] **Improve documentation** (update docs, add examples)
- [ ] **Performance optimization** (speed up slow operations)

## 🎯 Success Criteria
**How will we know when this technical debt is resolved?**

- Specific metrics to measure improvement
- Acceptance criteria for the solution
- How to verify the fix works
